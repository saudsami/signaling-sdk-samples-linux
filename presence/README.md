# Presence

In real-time messaging solutions, it is often important to know whether a user is currently online or offline. For example, in instant messaging, chat applications, and online collaboration tools, users need to see the availability of their contacts. This information is typically displayed as a status message or icon next to a user's name. Presence features in Signaling SDK enable you to monitor join, leave, and status change notifications for users in a channel. Using Presence features, you can:

* Get a list of users currently in a channel and their temporary status data.
* Get a list of channels a specified user has joined or is subscribed to.
* Read, set, or remove user status.
* Receive real-time event notifications when users join or leave specified channels.
* Receive user status change event notifications in real time.
