# Store channel and user data

Signaling storage enables you to save channel and user attributes in an easy-to-use, serverless storage system. This feature helps you build innovative, reliable, and scalable applications without the need to set up your own database.

Your app receives metadata modification events in real-time enabling you to update the front-end accordingly. You can leverage user and channel metadata in Signaling apps to:

- Personalize user profiles: Create user profiles that include additional information such as the user's full name, a 
profile picture URL, geographic location, and availability status.

- Maintain chat history: Store and display chat history, including timestamps and message status such as whether a message has been read or not.

- Maintain search history: Enable users to quickly search for specific messages, users, or topics within the app.

- Customize notifications: Enable users to customize their notification settings, such as choosing notifications to receive and setting custom alert tones.

- Enhance security: Enforce security measures, such as verifying user identity and encrypting messages.
