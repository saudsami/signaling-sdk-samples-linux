# Secure authentication with tokens

Authentication is the act of validating the identity of each user before they access your system. Agora uses digital tokens to authenticate users and their privileges before they log into the Signaling system.

This Signaling client app retrieves a Signaling token from the Signaling token server. This token authenticates the current user when the user accesses Signaling.
