# Store channel and user data

Signaling storage enables you to save channel and user attributes in an easy-to-use, serverless storage system. This feature helps you build innovative, reliable, and scalable applications without the need to set up your own database.

Your app receives metadata modification events in real-time enabling you to update the front-end accordingly. You can leverage user and channel metadata in Signaling apps to:

- Personalize user profiles
- Maintain chat history
- Maintain search history
- Customize notifications
- Enhance security
